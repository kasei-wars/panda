    <p><u>Lastly</u>, no random friend requests! Any messages asking/begging for gifts will be blocked and reported as spam. Any hate messages will be blocked and reported as well. If you have messaged me in regards to something, please allow me at least 48 hours to respond because I am <b>a college student</b> and I <b>work</b> so I may be busy, but I promise to get back to everyone.</p>
    <p>If I do not respond to your message, it is most likely because you asked something I have already answered or you did one of the above.</p>
    <p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> The panda I used to create this layout is known as the <b>MOCHI MOCHI PANDA</b> and is not my original work! (I just love the mochi mochi panda stickers...) All rights go to SONY and I have not profited from the work displayed here.</p>
