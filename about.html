    <p><b>Hello.</b> 안녕하세요. こんにちは。You can call me Voadicia or Tobi. My real name is <b>Marisa</b> and let's just say I am a complex person; but we'll start with the basics and if you care to read, then <i>be my guest!</i> I'm a college student in my junior year, my major is a Bachelor's in Graphic Design and I am 22 years old. I have a lot of hobbies but my main ones include coding, designing, and drawing.</p>
    <p>Now, who I am really? I am a lot of things, I am an <b>asshole</b> but I am also <b>kind</b>. Truth be told, I would say it all depends on the other person. I can be laid back, but usually only with those I trust. If someone I don't know is around, I may come off as stand-offish and a little stuck up. However, that is not always the case. I prefer people get to know me before they start getting too comfortable and making jokes at me, otherwise I will get defensive. Usually it is because I assume since I don't know them, that they are trying to insult me or make fun of me. Besides, I base a lot of my morals and manners off of basic conversational rules so I believe that if you wish to speak to someone, you begin with simply saying hello and getting to know them.</p>
    <p>As you can tell, I have a lot to say--only if the right questions are asked though! I have strong beliefs, most of what I believe I built from a lot of movies and TV shows I have watched over the years that inspired me. Some of the movies I want to mention that impacted me most are <b>Meet the Robinsons, Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs (1 & 2!), and Chicken Little.</b></p>
