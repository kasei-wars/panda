    <p><b>Hello.</b> 안녕하세요. こんにちは。You can call me Voadicia or Tobi. My real name is <b>Marisa</b> and let's just say I am a complex person; but we'll start with the basics and if you care to read, then <i>be my guest!</i> I'm a college student in my junior year, my major is a Bachelor's in Graphic Design and I am 22 years old. I have a lot of hobbies but my main ones include coding, designing, and drawing.</p>
    <p>Now, who I am really? I am a lot of things, I am an <b>asshole</b> but I am also <b>kind</b>. Truth be told, I would say it all depends on the other person. I can be laid back, but usually only with those I trust. If someone I don't know is around, I may come off as stand-offish and a little stuck up. However, that is not always the case. I prefer people get to know me before they start getting too comfortable and making jokes at me, otherwise I will get defensive. Usually it is because I assume since I don't know them, that they are trying to insult me or make fun of me. Besides, I base a lot of my morals and manners off of basic conversational rules so I believe that if you wish to speak to someone, you begin with simply saying hello and getting to know them.</p>
    <p>As you can tell, I have a lot to say--only if the right questions are asked though! I have strong beliefs, most of what I believe I built from a lot of movies and TV shows I have watched over the years that inspired me. Some of the movies I want to mention that impacted me most are <b>Meet the Robinsons, Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs (1 & 2!), and Chicken Little.</b> I give respect to everybody, if I do receive respect back, then I will alter my response and be colder towards the person. I <b>don't joke</b> with people that I <b>don't know</b>. This is not because I don't "have a sense of humor" or because I am "stuck up" but simply because I don't know the person well enough and I refrain from joking out of respect for them.</p>
    <p>I can be very caring but I can also be very cold. I'm not the most forgiving person, but that's because I have forgiven a lot in my past and have been burned many times. I will forgive, but not through words, through <b>actions only.</b> The reason I am explaining this is because I get the feeling people misinterpret me as a person, so I am hoping this will enlighten those who judge me right off the bat. When I am around a big group of people, I will usually be the quiet one in the background. When I am around people I know and trust, I will be silly and talk too much! One of my biggest pet peeves is people who talk at me. What I mean by that is, well, have you ever had a conversation with someone where all they do is blab on and on and on about themselves and you can barely get a word in and when you finally do say something, they completely ignore it and just keep blabbing? Yeah. I hate that with a burning passion. To me, a conversation is two people talking <b>WITH</b> each other. If you wish to talk solely about yourself well, <b>go write a blog or go find a wall to talk to.</b> 8)</p>
    <p>Now, you may wonder I picked Tobi to represent me. Let's just say that I understand his character on a deep, emotional level. He battles with multiple egos and that is something I find myself struggling with quite frequently. Being Tobi helps me because it is someone I can relate with. Though he may not be "real", he is very real in my heart and no, I'm not evil and want to destroy the world. Tobi is misunderstood and I have been misunderstood my entire life. Tobi is my alter ego.</p>
