    <p>"A woman loves you</br>
That woman loves you wholeheartedly</br>
She follows you around like a shadow every day</br>
She smiles, but she is actually <i>crying</i></p>
<p>How much longer do I have to look at you alone?</br>
This love that came likw <b>wind</b>,</br>
This love that is like a <b>beggar</b></br>
If I continue this way, will you love me?</p>
<p>Just come a little nearer, just a little bit</br>
When you come a step closer</br>
<b>Please, don't step back</b></br>
I, the one who loves you</br>
<i>Is still next to you.</i></br>
That woman is crying</p>
<p>That woman is very timid</br>
So she learned how to smile</br>
Hear heart is full of tears</br>
She can't even share her story with her best friend</p>
<p>That's why, that woman loved you</br>
Because you were so much like her</br>
Another fool</br>
Yet another fool</br>
Please, <b>give me one more hug</b> before you leave me</p>
<p>I <s>want</s> to be loved, my dear</br>
<i>That's all I wanted</i></br>
She <b>shouts</b>, just in her heart</br>
No one can hear her</br>
But that woman is still next to you.</p>
<p>Do you know that</br>
I am that woman?</br>
You don't know, <i>do you?</i></br>
Because you are just a <b>fool</b></br></p>
<p>How much</br>
How much longer</br>
Do I have to love you like this?</p>
<p>This love that is like a <b>fool</b></br>
This love that is like a <b>beggar</b></p>
<p>Would you love me?</br>
That woman, who loves you</br>
Is still next to you and she is still crying."</p>

<p><b>20.12.7</b></p>
<p>I turned around many times aready</br>
I laughed like it was nothing</br>
Even if I lied to my heart without words</br>
Are you wandering because you <b>don't know</b> my heart?</p>
<p>Suddenly I'm afraid, saying <b>I love you</b></br>
They're not words I'm used to saying</br>
With <b>hardened lips</b>, <i>I love you, I love you</i></br>
I am shouting those words on your back</p>
<p>Because we breathe the same air</br>
It would be <b>too much to ask for more.</b></br>
As love keeps growing without knowing</br>
<i>Only scars are coming back</i></p>
<p>Even though I'm hurt, <b>I'll be here.</b></br>
I can only smile when I'm next to you</br>
Can't be happy, can't be changed</br>
You're the one I chose</p>
<p>My bruised heart is full of scars</br>
When I look back, there are only tears</br>
I can't see because you can't find me</br>
<b>Even my love hides right away.</b></p>
<p>Because we breathe the same air</br>
It would be <b>too much to ask for more.</b></br>
As love keeps growing without knowing</br>
<i>Only scars are coming back</i></p>
<p>Even though I'm hurt, <b>I'll be here.</b></br>
I can only smile when I'm next to you</br>
Can't be happy, can't be changed</br>
You're the one I chose</p>
<p>Tryng hard to hide my tears</br>
Are you passing by?</br>
I turned around without telling you</br>
Even today, <b>I'm still there.</b></p>
<p>Filling my heart with tears</br>
I put those words in my heart</br>
I pass by like it was nothing</br>
And then I <b>beat my chest</b></p>
