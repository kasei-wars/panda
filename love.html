    <p><b>20.12.05</b></p>
    <p>"A woman loves you</br>
That woman loves you wholeheartedly</br>
She follows you around like a shadow every day</br>
She smiles, but she is actually <i>crying</i></p>
<p>How much longer do I have to look at you alone?</br>
This love that came likw <b>wind</b>,</br>
This love that is like a <b>beggar</b></br>
If I continue this way, will you love me?</p>
<p>Just come a little nearer, just a little bit</br>
When you come a step closer</br>
<b>Please, don't step back</b></br>
I, the one who loves you</br>
<i>Is still next to you.</i></br>
That woman is crying</p>
<p>That woman is very timid</br>
So she learned how to smile</br>
Hear heart is full of tears</br>
She can't even share her story with her best friend</p>
<p>That's why, that woman loved you</br>
Because you were so much like her</br>
Another fool</br>
Yet another fool</br>
Please, <b>give me one more hug</b> before you leave me</p>
<p>I <s>want</s> to be loved, my dear</br>
<i>That's all I wanted</i></br>
She <b>shouts</b>, just in her heart</br>
No one can hear her</br>
But that woman is still next to you.</p>
<p>Do you know that</br>
I am that woman?</br>
You don't know, <i>do you?</i></br>
Because you are just a <b>fool</b></br></p>
<p>How much</br>
How much longer</br>
Do I have to love you like this?</p>
<p>This love that is like a <b>fool</b></br>
This love that is like a <b>beggar</b></p>
<p>Would you love me?</br>
That woman, who loves you</br>
Is still next to you and she is still crying."</p>
